Since then I have always carried on developing my interest and skills in coding. I managed to self-learn several different computer languages, including Javascript, HTML/CSS, C++, TensorFlow, and R. I have increased my versality in my coding abilities and created different applications. Some of which are a mock wordle, an A.I-based application, a business website, and this profile. All of this profile was designing solely through HTML/CSS and Javascript.</span>

My research paper, Review of Nanoparticle-Based Drug Delivery Methods in Conjunction With
                Antisense Oligonucleotide for the Treatment of Spinal Muscular Atrophy, focuses on  this concept and was recently published in the Curieux Academic Journal.</span></div>
